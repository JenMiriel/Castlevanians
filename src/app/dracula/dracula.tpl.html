    <h2>Why should you contact us?</h2>

    <p>
        The Belmont Clan has been fighting Dracula and his minions for over 500 years, since
        the 1400's.  We carefully and thoroughly train each slayer each generation to give you
        the absolute best chance of ridding evil forever.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most likely, a member of our Clan will put Dracula to rest for another 100 years or
        so.  Don't worry!  This just gives us another opportunity to finish the Lord of
        Darkness another generation when we are stronger.  We will rid the land of his
        evil influence.  Guaranteed.
